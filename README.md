# Battleship

### Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
* we put our heads together to reach the desired final outcome. We built the methods by working backwards from the desired result.
### If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
* Getting a fresh board after restarting the game and iteration 4.
## Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
* We used both ping pong and working together at the same time.
## Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
* We talked everyday to go over problems with the code and about any changes that needed to be implemented. We would work together in a video call.
